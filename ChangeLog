	* tcl/string.bench: Extended string append benchmarks to exploit
	new growth algorithm for string objects in Tcl 8.4a2.

2000-05-31  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* runbench.tcl: new options -errors (passed to libbench), -verbose
	(by default we are now quieter on output), -output <text|list|csv>
	(different output types - csv is char-sep-value for Excel).
	Added start/finish times (in -verbose mode).
	* libbench.tcl: libbench now takes -option switches for
	flexibility, options for -errors BOOL (error suppression), -interp
	NAME (to specify interp), -match PATTERN (glob pattern to filter
	tests by desc), -iters NUM (default number of iters to run).
	Reorganized how data is returned to runbench master.

	* tk/entry.bench (new):
	* tk/canvas.bench (new): new tests for widget creation, config

	* tcl/array.bench (removed):
	* tcl/vars.bench: merged array.bench tests into VAR

	* runbench.tcl: added -match, -notcl, -notk options, restructured
	startup sequence.

	* libbench.tcl: added ability to return string values from bench
	tests and support for filtering tests to run.

	* tcl/string.bench: moved string mapping benchmarks and added more
	string equality benchmarks
	* tcl/map.bench: added extended string mapping benchmark

	* tcl/read.bench:
	* tcl/startup.bench:
