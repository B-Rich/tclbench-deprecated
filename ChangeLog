	* tcl/string.bench: Extended string append benchmarks to exploit
	new growth algorithm for string objects in Tcl 8.4a2.

2000-05-31  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* runbench.tcl: new options -errors (passed to libbench), -verbose
	(by default we are now quieter on output), -output <text|list|csv>
	(different output types - csv is char-sep-value for Excel).
	Added start/finish times (in -verbose mode).
	* libbench.tcl: libbench now takes -option switches for
	flexibility, options for -errors BOOL (error suppression), -interp
	NAME (to specify interp), -match PATTERN (glob pattern to filter
	tests by desc), -iters NUM (default number of iters to run).
	Reorganized how data is returned to runbench master.

	* tk/entry.bench (new):
	* tk/canvas.bench (new): new tests for widget creation, config

	* tcl/array.bench (removed):
	* tcl/vars.bench: merged array.bench tests into VAR

	* tcl/map.bench: fixed for compatability with Tcl7.4-
