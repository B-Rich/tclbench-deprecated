.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBlibbench\fR provides the support commands to use in the
benchmark scripts executed by the \fBtclbench\fR application. They
provide functionality to portably generate names for temporary files,
delete files and to declare benchmarks.
.PP
The public interface is made up from the following commands:
.TP
\fBbench_tmpfile\fR
Generates names for temporary files used by benchmarks. Returns a new
name for each call of the command.
.TP
\fBbench_rm\fR \fIfile...\fR
Silently deletes all the files whose names were specified as arguments
for the command. Errors during the deletion are ignored. In other
words, this command does a best-effort but gives no guarantees that
the files are actually rmeoved.
.TP
\fBbench\fR \fI-option value ...\fR
Declares a benchmark to execute. Expects that the benchmark exits
cleanly. In other words, errors are not caught and thrown to the
top. The exceptions to this is the special errorcode 666 which
declares that the accompanying string is the benchmark value instead
of the time. The main use to signal missing features required by the
benchmark. The following options are recognized by the command. At
least the options \fI-body\fR and \fI-desc\fR are required for the
correct interaction of the benchmark with the management.
.RS
.TP
\fB-pre\fR
The value of this option is a tcl script. This script is executed
before the main timed body and should setup variables, files,
etc. required by the benchmark. This script is not timed.
.TP
\fB-post\fR
The value of this option is a tcl script. This script is executed
after the main timed body and should be used to tear down resources
setup by the \fB-pre\fR script.
.TP
\fB-body\fR
The value of this option is a tcl script. This is the script which is
run as the main body of the benchmark and its execution is timed.
.TP
\fB-desc\fR
The value of this option is a string to be used in the output of the
framework to describe the executed benchmark. Although not enforced it
makes sense to make this value unique over all benchmark scripts
belonging together.
.TP
\fB-iterations\fR
The value of this option is a positive integer number and declares how
often the body should be executed to get accurate timing results. This
is a maximum value which can be overidden by the global management of
a benchmark run.
