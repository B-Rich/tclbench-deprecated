.SH NAME
runbench.tcl \- Main application for executing benchmarks
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrunbench.tcl\fR \fI?-option value ...? ?file ...?\fR
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBrunbench.tcl\fR application provides the overall management for
the execution of benchmarks. If no specific benchmark files are
provided on the command line itself the application will use all
\fI.bench\fR files in the subdirectories \fBtcl\fR and \fBtk\fR of the
directory containing the application itself. If files are provided all
files matching the glob pattern \fB*tk*\fR are assumed to be
benchmarks for the Tk toolkit.
.PP
The following options are recognized by the application:
.TP
\fB-help\fR
Causes the application to print a list of the recognized option plus
short explanations of their meaning.
.TP
\fB-throwerrors\fR
Forces the application to bubble errors up, possibly causing the benchmark
run to stop.  By default errors during tests are suppressed if they occur,
and \fBERR\fR is noted in the output for that test.
.TP
\fB-iterations\fR
The value of this option is a positive integer number and declares how
often the body of benchmarks should be executed to get accurate timing
results. This is a global maximum value which can be overidden by the
individual benchmarks.
.TP
\fB-minversion\fR
Declares the minimum version of tcl interpreters the application is
allowed to use in the benchmarking.
.TP
\fB-maxversion\fR
Declares the maximum version of tcl interpreters the application is
allowed to use in the benchmarking.
.TP
\fB-rmatch\fR
Restricts the benchmarking to benchmarks whose description matches
the regexp pattern specified as the value of this option. If both
\fI-match\fR and \fI-rmatch\fR are specified benchmarks have to
fulfill both conditions to be executed.
.TP
\fB-match\fR
Restricts the benchmarking to benchmarks whose description matches the
glob pattern specified as the value of this option. If both
\fI-match\fR and \fI-rmatch\fR are specified benchmarks have to
fulfill both conditions to be executed.
.TP
\fB-normalize\fR
Takes a version number as value and causes the application to
normalize the timing values to the value of the given version.
.TP
\fB-notcl\fR
Forces the application to skip all tcl related benchmarks. Takes no
additional value.
.TP
\fB-notk\fR
Forces the application to skip all tk related benchmarks. Takes no
additional value.
.TP
\fB-output\fR
Declares the style to use when generating the output for the
benchmarks. Accepts \fBtext\fR, \fBcsv\fR and \fBlist\fR. The first
value is the default.
.TP
\fB-paths\fR
Accepts a list of paths to search for tcl interpreters. If no paths
are specified the paths in the environment variable \fBPATH\fR are
used.
.TP
\fB-verbose\fR
Activates the output of interim status info. Takes no additional
value.
